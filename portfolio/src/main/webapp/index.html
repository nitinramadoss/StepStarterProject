          I have been learning how to program for roughly 6 years now.
          I began with learning web development for an FBLA competition and I now build android applications 
          for national competitions like PennApps and for my personal developer account on the Play Store. 
          Software development is one of my favorite subfields in computer science. 
          Throughout my junior and senior year in high school, I taught students how to program in a 
          computer science club that I founder. My goal is to lead emerging technologies and build software 
          that can make a postive impact in society.

          I am an enthusiastic tennis player with a love for competition. 
          I also enjoy playing the south asian drums for concerts around my area. 
          In the past, I used to play a variety of sports such as baskletball and soccer. 
          I also used to play the piano and the violin. 
          More recently, I have taken an interest in creative writing, 
          writing poems for contests and works in my spare time.
